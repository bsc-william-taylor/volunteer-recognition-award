# UWS Volunteer Recognition Award

The volunteering module was a chance for students in any year to volunteer and work towards an award which recognised their achievments. Each student had the opportunity to take a pre-existing volunteering position. I decided to help start and run the first coding clubs in Renfrewshire. This repository just houses copies of the documents required for the volunteering module which I took in my final year at the University of the West of Scotland. 

## Assignment

There were three documents in total that I hade to write to pass this module which were simply reviews of my tasks and duties as a Coding Mentor in Paisley and Linwood. The sign off sheet was just a written statement from the voluntering organisation stating that what was written in the volunteering report was accurate. The volunteering report was just a chance to report on the role you played and a chance to reflect on what you have learned. Finally the activity review was just a log off all the volunteering sesions you undertook.

**Documents Required:** 

* Signoff Sheet
* Volunteer Report
* Activity Review

## Submission

All documents were completed and submitted and upon submission I received the Volunteer Award with Leadership for my work with teaching kids basic programming skills. I also continued to work as a volunteer after the module to ensure work taken to establish the coding clubs did not go away.
